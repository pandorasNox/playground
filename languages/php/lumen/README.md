# Lumen

Here I try the PHP Lumen framework with different test projects.

Projects:
- Usercity (name of the Project)
    - small service which probbely is able to GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE useres
    - at the beginning we aim to just get one endpoint who returns "Hello World, Lumen here."
    - later on we may put more of the user functionallity into it
